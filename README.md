Here's a detailed description of the **User Management Application** project for your resume:

---

### **Project: User Management Application**  
**Description**:  
Developed a full-stack web application to manage user information, including features like user creation, updating, deletion, and role-based access control. The application provides an intuitive interface for administrators to manage users efficiently and is built using modern web technologies.

---

### **Key Responsibilities**:  
1. **Frontend Development**:
   - Built an interactive and responsive user interface using **React.js**.
   - Implemented state management with **Redux** for seamless user interaction and data flow.
   - Used **React Router** for dynamic routing and navigation between pages (e.g., user list, add user, edit user).
   - Styled components using **CSS Modules** and integrated third-party libraries like **Material-UI** for better UI/UX.

2. **Backend Development**:
   - Designed and developed RESTful APIs using **.Net 6** to handle CRUD operations for user data.
   - Applied secure authentication and authorization using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.
   - Optimized the backend logic for scalability and performance.

3. **Database Design**:
   - Modeled relational database schemas in **Microsoft SQL Server** to store user and role data.
   - Used **Entity Framework Core** as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to simplify database interactions.
   - Implemented migrations for schema evolution and query optimizations for faster performance.

4. **Integration**:
   - Connected the React frontend to the .Net backend APIs.
   - Ensured seamless data communication using **Axios** for API calls.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Containerized the application using **Docker**.
   - Deployed the application on **AWS ECS** with an **RDS (Relational Database Service)** instance for the database.

6. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Developed **unit tests** for backend APIs using **xUnit**.
   - Conducted end-to-end testing using tools like **Postman** and **Selenium**.
   - Debugged and resolved bugs using **Visual Studio** and **Chrome DevTools**.

### **Technologies Used**:
- **Frontend**: React.js, Redux, Material-UI, Axios
- **Backend**: .Net 6, ASP.Net Core Web API, JWT Authentication
- **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server, Entity Framework Core
- **Tools & Platforms**: Docker, AWS ECS, RDS, Visual Studio, Git, Postman
- **Testing**: xUnit, Postman, Selenium

---

### **Achievements**:
- Reduced user data retrieval time by **30%** through optimized SQL queries and API design.
- Enhanced application reliability by implementing comprehensive **unit tests** covering **90%** of the codebase.
- Deployed the application successfully on AWS with a **zero-downtime** deployment process.
